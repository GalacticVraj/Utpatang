## 🚀 Unique Features

### 1. 🏭 Equipment Management
- **Detailed Inventory**: Track equipment name, serial number, department, and location.
- **Smart Assignment**: Link each equipment to a specific **Maintenance Team** and **Default Technician**.
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor purchase dates, warranty expiry, and scrap status.

### 2. 🔧 Maintenance Request System (The Core)
- **Auto-Fill Logic**: When a user selects a piece of equipment, the system **automatically fetches** and fills the responsible Team and Technician.
- **Request Types**: Supports both **Corrective** (Breakdown) and **Preventive** (Scheduled) maintenance.
- **Status Workflow**: Track requests from `New` -> `In Progress` -> `Completed`.

### 3. 📅 Future Modules (Planned)
- **Kanban Board**: Visual drag-and-drop interface for task management.
